            <p>“When it comes to things to do in South Lake Tahoe, you can shred down the mountain from 10,067 ft. at
                Heavenly Mountain Resort's peak or you can dive into the depths of Lake Tahoe. It's more than 1600 ft.
                deep, making it one of the deepest lakes in North America. Needless to say, there's plenty of things to
                do in Lake Tahoe above and below the surface.”

            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
