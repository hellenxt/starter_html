                <p>Santa was born during COVID on 1/10/2021, she's 2 years and half now. She's a Devon Rex which means
                    her personality is more like a doy lol. </p>

                <img src="images/rocket_primary.jpg" width="400" alt="Santa is a lap cat and loves human">

                <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                    Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                    Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.
                </p>
                <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will ‘say hi’ to you
                    after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size
                    dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be
                    super happy the whole day.
                </p>

                <img src="images/staring.jpg" width="400" alt="Smoothie is staring">

                <p>Smoothie has been dubbed the "world's most photogenic cat", and her emerald eyes and golden fur have
                    even inspired a mural in New Zealand. Smoothie also has an aptly-named brother named Milkshake, and
                    the two are often featured together across social media platforms.

                <img src="images/juno_profile.jpg" width="400" alt="juno is lying on the ground">

                <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted
                    before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the
                    same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is
                    dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.
                </p>

                <img src="images/maple_selfie.jpg" width="400" alt="this is a picture of Maple">

                <p>Maple is a 2 year old tabby cat with brown stripes. She is very playful and friendly but also loves
                    lounging in the sun! Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal
                    some extra treats.

                <p>"Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an
                    affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30
                    AM were a daily routine.

                <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
